# skyEvents

A simple app I am building with a personal aim of learning Spring MVC. This app will be using an XML as its datasource for the list of upcoming Astronomical events. The app will expose REST endpoints for retreiving these data.

#Set up Instructions
I am using IntelliJ for this example. 

1. Import as a Maven project by importing the pom.xml
2. Make sure you have Lombak plugin installed and activated.
3. If IntelliJ still complains, make sure Compiler > Annotation Processors> Enable annotation processing is selected.
